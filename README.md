# powerbi-visuals-example-simple-line-chart

This is a very simple demonstration of migrating a regular d3.js line chart into the Power BI Custom Visuals SDK, and is documented in these online posts:

* [Lifting and Shifting a Simple d3.js Line Chart into A Power BI Custom Visual (Part 1)](https://coacervo.co/examples/d3-line-chart-1)
* [Lifting and Shifting a Simple d3.js Line Chart into A Power BI Custom Visual (Part 2)](https://coacervo.co/examples/d3-line-chart-2)

Please refer to these articles for further details.

To work with this repository, you will need the Power BI Custom Visuals SDK installed. [Refer here for instructions on setting up your developer environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/custom-visual-develop-tutorial#setting-up-the-developer-environment).

Once checked out, and the pre-requisites set up, you just need to run:

```
npm i
```

From the root of the checkout, and then:

```
pbiviz start
```

To run the visual server. You can then test in the Power BI service.
